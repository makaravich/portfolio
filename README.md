**Duration**: Feb, 2024 – Aug, 2024

**Website**: [https://checkmarx.com/](https://checkmarx.com/)

**Description**:

This website was developed for a major company in the cybersecurity industry. The project included several hundred pages built using a variety of custom templates.

One of the most interesting challenges was the client’s request to preserve part of the website from the previous version without any modifications. This unconventional architectural requirement could not be achieved using standard WordPress tools. However, I implemented several unique backend solutions that allowed us to fulfill all of the client's expectations seamlessly.

I worked on this project as a backend WordPress developer. My responsibilities included:

- Planning and estimating development timelines  
- Creating a detailed roadmap for component development, including specifications, deadlines, and functional descriptions  
- Developing custom Gutenberg blocks for various page templates  
- Integrating these Gutenberg blocks with the front-end codebase  
- Connecting the site with multiple third-party APIs  
- Ensuring high standards of performance and security  
- Automating the migration of content from the legacy version of the site  
- Writing technical documentation  
- Providing ongoing technical support to the client

This project demonstrated my ability to handle complex architecture and deliver reliable, scalable solutions for enterprise-level WordPress websites.

**Key Skills**: WordPress, PHP, Gutenberg blocks, ACF, Support, API

## Website for an IT-company

**Duration**: May, 2022 – Sep, 2022

**Website**: [https://sqream.com/](https://sqream.com/)

**Description**:

This website, like many of my projects, was built using the WordPress CMS as the foundation. A custom theme was developed entirely from scratch to meet the client’s specific design and functionality requirements.

To streamline the development process and ensure flexibility in content management, I utilized the Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin. Using ACF, I created a set of modular page templates that were later styled and finalized by front-end developers according to the approved design.

As a backend PHP developer on the project, my responsibilities included:

- Designing the software architecture of the website  
- Writing efficient, scalable backend code and building custom PHP modules  
- Integrating third-party APIs, such as Comeet, to enhance functionality  
- Collaborating closely with front-end developers and other team members to ensure a cohesive and user-friendly product  
- Migrating data from the client’s previous website  
- Finalizing backend features and conducting thorough testing before launch  

The result was a robust, maintainable, and fully customized WordPress site tailored to the client’s business needs.
