**Description**:

My client approached me with the goal of developing a modern and functional website for a software company. Starting from a provided mock-up, I built the entire site from scratch using the Divi theme as a foundation. The project involved implementing a range of customized features tailored to the client’s needs. The website supports multiple languages to cater to an international audience and includes a dynamic news feed to keep users updated with the latest company announcements. I also created several custom shortcodes to simplify content management and enhance the site's flexibility. Additionally, I extended the default WooCommerce functionality to support specific business logic and improve the overall user experience.

**Key Skills**: PHP, WooCommerce, HTML5, WordPress, WordPress Plugin
