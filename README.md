**Duration**: Feb, 2024 – Aug, 2024

This website was developed for a major company in the cybersecurity industry. The project included several hundred pages built using a variety of custom templates.

- Planning and estimating development timelines  
- Creating a detailed roadmap for component development, including specifications, deadlines, and functional descriptions  
- Developing custom Gutenberg blocks for various page templates  
- Integrating these Gutenberg blocks with the front-end codebase  
- Connecting the site with multiple third-party APIs  
- Ensuring high standards of performance and security  
- Automating the migration of content from the legacy version of the site  
- Writing technical documentation  
- Providing ongoing technical support to the client

**Website**: [https://sqream.com/](https://sqream.com/)

**Duration**: May, 2022 – Sep, 2022

**Description**:

This website, like many of my projects, was built using the WordPress CMS as the foundation. A custom theme was developed entirely from scratch to meet the client’s specific design and functionality requirements.

As a backend PHP developer on the project, my responsibilities included:

- Designing the software architecture of the website  
- Writing efficient, scalable backend code and building custom PHP modules  
- Integrating third-party APIs, such as Comeet, to enhance functionality  
- Collaborating closely with front-end developers and other team members to ensure a cohesive and user-friendly product  
- Migrating data from the client’s previous website  
- Finalizing backend features and conducting thorough testing before launch  

The result was a robust, maintainable, and fully customized WordPress site tailored to the client’s business needs.
